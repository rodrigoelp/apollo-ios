## 🚧 Work In Progress 🚧

> NOTE! This tutorial is still under construction, so particularly when you get to the end of the current completed bits, things may sputter out a little bit. We'll be making an official announcement and removing this section when the tutorial is completed.

Welcome! This tutorial demonstrates adding the Apollo iOS SDK to an app to communicate with a GraphQL server. It was prepared with the following tools:

- Xcode 11.2
- Swift 5.1
- Apollo iOS SDK 0.21.0

The tutorial assumes that you're using a Mac with Xcode installed. It also assumes some prior experience with iOS development.

> If you encounter any issues during the tutorial, feel free to ask questions by either [opening an issue on our GitHub repo](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/issues) or [stopping by our Spectrum Chat for help](https://spectrum.chat/apollo/apollo-ios).

## What are you building?

This tutorial takes you through building an app to "book a seat" on any of the rockets that have been sent into space by [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/). Along the way, you'll build out functionality that uses the following features of the Apollo iOS SDK:

* Schema downloading
* Code generation
* Queries and mutations
* Error handling
* File uploads [_coming soon_]
* Query watching [_coming soon_]
* Subscriptions [_coming soon_]

A pre-built GraphQL server is provided for your app to execute operations against at [`https://apollo-fullstack-tutorial.herokuapp.com/`](https://apollo-fullstack-tutorial.herokuapp.com/).
